# Multi Threaded Web Server

This project was my introduction to Rust in a unique way I still needed to explore.

I aimed to create a multi-threaded web server with my newfound knowledge of Rust.

This project was a great way to challenge my comfort zone when it came to programming. I was in an entirely new territory, both unfilial with Rust and web servers.

I would say the most exciting part of this project was learning about how the internet worked. I was able to learn some about HTTP and TCP. I learned how to a properer HTML responses and parse a few requests. This helped put everything into perspective as I was used to making a web app but unfamiliar with how they deployed.
